tictactoe gameboard - tree of positions, defined when needed (i.e like the 'near infinite tree of chess moves')
need to be able to enforce something like (Move 1 (Move 1 Empty)) as being an invalid type

b = newGame :: Board
b = move(X 1 b)
move(X 1 b) -- won't compile

.. so the type of b must change 
.. type must define unique states of board e.g. 
type X_IN_BOTTOM_LEFT
.... so something like this might help:
data Board a b = Left a | Right b  

... use kinds?
enforce the type to be of a specific kind?


API
==========--------------
move: takes a tic-tac-toe board and position and moves to that position (if not occupied) returning a new board. This function can only be called on a board that is empty or in-play. Calling move on a game board that is finished is a compile-time type error.

oldB = start
-- Calling move on a game board that is finished is a compile-time type error
-- i.e type error if more than 5 moves played
newB = move oldB ('X',1)



Board = move Board Position
Player|Draw = whoWon Board 
Player|Empty = playerAt Position
