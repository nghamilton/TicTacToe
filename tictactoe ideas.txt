tictactoe gameboard - tree of positions, defined when needed (i.e like the 'near infinite tree of chess moves')
need to be able to enforce something like (Move 1 (Move 1 Empty)) as being an invalid type

b = newGame :: Board
b = move(X 1 b)
move(X 1 b) -- won't compile

.. so the type of b must change 
.. type must define unique states of board e.g. 
type X_IN_BOTTOM_LEFT
.... so something like this might help:
data Board a b = Left a | Right b  

... use kinds?
enforce the type to be of a specific kind?


board variable is a function that takes a position and returns a new board (or something to process)
move is a typeclass method that is available on all board functions

.....

in order to parse context-sensitive languages a Monad interface is needed

API
==========--------------
move: takes a tic-tac-toe board and position and moves to that position (if not occupied) returning a new board. This function can only be called on a board that is empty or in-play. Calling move on a game board that is finished is a compile-time type error.

oldB = start
-- Calling move on a game board that is finished is a compile-time type error
-- i.e type error if more than 9 moves played
newB = move oldB ('X',1)



Board = move Board Position
Player|Draw = whoWon Board 
Player|Empty = playerAt Position



--Creates a superset (i.e all possible sets of 1..9)
filterM (\x -> [True, False]) [1..9] 

* create a monad for the board:
 - a combination of the State and the AParser.hs monads
 - the context is the starting player, and the moves played
 - the value is the state of the board - playable or unplayable etc
 - the board monad has one function to access a field, which has a type of Int->Board
 - when run against a board (i.e move' b 1) the function returns a new board mobit
 - the returned type will be either a Board Playable or Board Unplayable
 - api exported function will be move :: (Int,Board Playable) -> Board ???
  ..... again have the problem of type definition being too restrictive (ie cant return both Board Playable or Unplayable)
